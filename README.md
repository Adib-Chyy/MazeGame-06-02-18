# MazeGame-06-02-18
This is a late-stage build of my final project for ICS3U. The premise is very simple; reach the end of the maze as the green box before time runs out, and do not collide with any of the walls. The game is almost fully functional. Some edges of the wall still do not respond to collision. Furthermore, I would like to implement some options to make the game more user friendly, such as a pause menu.
